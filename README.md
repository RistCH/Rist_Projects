# MY PROJECTS/PROGRAMS

This our project in data structure where we applied the concept of queue in python. Our professor doesnt require us to add database but I added anyway since we also used MongoDB NoSQL in DBMS which made me think to try add database. 
I did all of this when I was a 2nd year college student.
